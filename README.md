# dx-data-sharer

## Introduction

This plugin is intended for customers of DX (https://getdx.com/). It shares Jenkins build data with DX.

To run this plugin locally:
- Install Jenkins: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/getting-started/
- Setup your developer environment: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial/prepare/
- `mvn hpi:run -Dport=5000`
- Navigate to http://localhost:5000/jenkins

To generate a *.hpi file:
- `mvn package`

## Getting started
### Installing the Plugin

- Click "Manage Jenkins"
